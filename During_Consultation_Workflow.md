## Phase 1: Introduction & Goal Setting (0-10 min)

### Opening (0-2 min)
- [ ] Welcome and establish rapport
- [ ] Start recording (if agreed upon)
- [ ] Confirm time available
  > "We have 45 minutes together. I'll make sure we save the last 5 minutes for wrapping up and next steps."

### Context Review (2-5 min)
- [ ] Confirm you understand their research area
  > "Tell me briefly about your research and how this code fits in."

- [ ] Clarify immediate goals for this session
  > "What would make this session most valuable for you today?"

- [ ] Verify what they've tried already
  > "What have you already attempted?"

- [ ] Assess urgency and constraints
  > "Are there any deadlines or time pressures I should know about?"

### Priority Setting (5-10 min)
- [ ] Summarize their goals
  > "So it sounds like you want to focus on X, Y, and Z. Is that right?"

- [ ] Establish realistic scope
  > "Given our 45 minutes, I suggest we prioritize X first, then move to Y if we have time."

- [ ] Get client agreement
  > "Does that sound good to you?"

- [ ] Set expectation for follow-up if needed
  > "If we don't cover everything, we can schedule a follow-up."

**Quick note**: What's the #1 priority?

## Phase 2: Active Consultation (10-40 min)

### General Principles Throughout
- **Think aloud**: Explain your thought process as you work
- **Ask questions**: Ensure you understand their code and context
- **Teach, don't just fix**: Explain the "why" behind recommendations
- **Check understanding**: Pause regularly for questions
- **Watch the clock**: Check time at 20, 30, and 35-minute marks

### Core Activities (Choose based on session type)

#### 🔍 Code Review Mode
- [ ] **Start with strengths** (2-3 min)
  - Point out what they're doing well
  - Build confidence before critiques

- [ ] **Systematic review** (15-20 min)
  - Work through code section by section
  - Use Python Code Review Checklist as guide
  - Prioritize: bugs > performance > readability > style
  - Demonstrate fixes with examples
  
  **Live review structure:**
  1. "Let's start with the overall structure..."
  2. "Looking at this function/class..."
  3. "One thing I notice is..."
  4. "Here's how you could improve this..."
  5. "Does that make sense?"

- [ ] **Provide live examples** (5-10 min)
  - Show better patterns with actual code
  - Refactor a section together
  - Demonstrate tools (linters, formatters)

#### 🏗️ Architecture/Design Mode
- [ ] **Understand requirements** (5 min)
  - What needs to happen?
  - What might change in the future?
  - Performance or scalability concerns?

- [ ] **Discuss current approach** (5-10 min)
  - Walk through existing design
  - Identify pain points
  - Note coupling and dependencies

- [ ] **Propose improvements** (10-15 min)
  - Sketch new structure (diagram or pseudocode)
  - Explain design principles being applied
  - Show example module/class structures
  - Discuss trade-offs

- [ ] **Create implementation plan** (5 min)
  - Break down into steps
  - Identify quick wins
  - Suggest incremental approach

#### 📚 Training/Best Practices Mode
- [ ] **Assess current knowledge** (3-5 min)
  - What do they already know?
  - What have they tried?

- [ ] **Teach concept** (10-15 min)
  - Explain the concept clearly
  - Use analogies from their domain if possible
  - Show examples

- [ ] **Hands-on practice** (10-15 min)
  - Live code together
  - Have them try with your guidance
  - Troubleshoot in real-time

- [ ] **Provide resources** (2-5 min)
  - Share documentation links
  - Provide practice exercises
  - Suggest next learning steps

#### 🐛 Debugging/Troubleshooting Mode
- [ ] **Reproduce the issue** (5 min)
  - Get the error to occur
  - Read error messages together
  - Note when it happens

- [ ] **Systematic investigation** (15-20 min)
  - Form hypotheses
  - Test them one by one
  - Use debugging tools
  - Teach debugging strategies as you go
  
  **Debugging workflow to model:**
  1. Read the error message carefully
  2. Identify the line number
  3. Check variable values
  4. Trace back the flow
  5. Form hypothesis
  6. Test with print statements or debugger

- [ ] **Fix and verify** (5 min)
  - Implement solution
  - Test that it works
  - Explain why it works now

- [ ] **Prevent recurrence** (3-5 min)
  - Suggest preventive measures
  - Discuss testing approaches
  - Add assertions or validation

### Time Check Points

**At 20 minutes (halfway)**
- [ ] Assess progress on main goal
- [ ] Adjust pace if needed
- [ ] Confirm still on the right track
  > "We're halfway through. Are we addressing what you need?"

**At 30 minutes (10 min left of active work)**
- [ ] Decide if current topic needs wrap-up
- [ ] Determine if you can address secondary goals
- [ ] Start transitioning to conclusions
  > "We have about 10 minutes left for active work. Should we continue with this or move to your second question?"

**At 35-38 minutes (wrap-up imminent)**
- [ ] Begin transitioning to summary
- [ ] Finish current thought but don't start new topics
- [ ] Start formulating action items mentally
  > "Let me finish this thought, then we'll summarize what we've covered."

---

## Phase 3: Summary & Next Steps (40-45 min)

### Recap (40-42 min)
- [ ] **Summarize what you covered**
  > "Okay, let's recap what we discussed today..."
  
  Key points covered:
  1. 
  2. 
  3. 

- [ ] **Highlight key takeaways**
  > "The most important things to remember are..."

- [ ] **Quick validation**
  > "Does that align with what you got from our session?"

### Action Items (42-44 min)
- [ ] **Provide clear next steps**
  > "Here's what I recommend you do next..."
  
  Client action items:
  - [ ] 
  - [ ] 
  - [ ] 

- [ ] **Prioritize actions**
  > "If you only do one thing, start with..."

- [ ] **Set realistic expectations**
  > "This might take you [X hours/days]. Don't worry if it takes time to implement."

### Follow-up Planning (44-45 min)
- [ ] **Determine follow-up needs**
  > "Would you like to schedule a follow-up session?"
  
  - [ ] Not needed - client feels confident
  - [ ] Helpful but not urgent - schedule for 1-2 weeks
  - [ ] Needed - schedule within days

- [ ] **Promise deliverables**
  > "I'll send you a summary email with all the resources and code examples within 24 hours."

- [ ] **Invite questions**
  > "Any final questions before we wrap up?"

- [ ] **Encouragement**
  > "You're on the right track. This is going to really improve your workflow."

### Closing
- [ ] Thank them for their time
- [ ] Stop recording
- [ ] Confirm contact information
- [ ] End on time!

## Communication Best Practices

### Do's ✅
- **Use their terminology**: Mirror their research language when possible
- **Explain jargon**: Don't assume knowledge of software terms
- **Show enthusiasm**: Be genuinely interested in their work
- **Be encouraging**: Research coding is hard; validate their efforts
- **Ask permission**: "Can I share my screen?" "Mind if I edit this?"
- **Check in frequently**: "Does this make sense?" "Questions so far?"
- **Use examples**: Show, don't just tell
- **Be honest**: If you don't know, say so and offer to research

### Don'ts ❌
- **Don't overwhelm**: Limit recommendations to what's actionable
- **Don't criticize harshly**: Frame as growth opportunities
- **Don't assume knowledge**: Verify understanding of concepts
- **Don't go over time**: Respect the 45-minute boundary
- **Don't write code for them**: Teach them to do it
- **Don't use complex jargon**: Keep language accessible
- **Don't commit to out-of-scope work**: Maintain boundaries

- Offer to address in follow-up or via email
- Document for later discussion

### Issue is beyond your expertise
- Be honest: "This is outside my area of expertise"

## Self-Monitoring During Session

Quick mental checks throughout:
- [ ] Am I explaining clearly?

- [ ] Are we on track for our goals?
- [ ] Am I teaching or just fixing?
- [ ] What's the time?
- [ ] Is this actionable for them?

---

## Immediate Post-Session (1-2 min)

- [ ] Note key action items while fresh
- [ ] Flag any follow-up research needed
- [ ] Rate session success (mental note)
- [ ] Jot down anything to improve for next time
