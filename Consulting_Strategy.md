# Research Software Engineer Consulting Strategy

## Mission Statement
To empower PhD students and postdocs with the software engineering skills, practices, and architectural knowledge they need to conduct robust, reproducible, and efficient research.

## Core Philosophy

### 1. Education Over Implementation
- **Teach, don't just fix**: Focus on transferring knowledge, not just solving immediate problems
- **Sustainable solutions**: Ensure clients can maintain and extend the work independently
- **Build confidence**: Help researchers see themselves as capable software developers

### 2. Research-Aware Approach
- **Respect domain expertise**: Researchers are experts in their field; we're experts in software
- **Understand research constraints**: Academic timelines, publishing pressures, and funding limitations
- **Balance ideal vs. practical**: Recommend best practices, but acknowledge when "good enough" is appropriate
- **Reproducibility first**: Prioritize practices that enhance research reproducibility

### 3. Incremental Improvement
- **Small wins matter**: Celebrate progress, even if perfection isn't achieved
- **Prioritize impact**: Focus on changes that provide the most value for time invested
- **Iterative refinement**: Support ongoing improvement through multiple sessions when needed

## Consultation Process

### Session Types

#### 1. Discovery Session (First-time clients)
- **Goal**: Understand the research context, current challenges, and desired outcomes
- **Time allocation**: 10 min context, 25 min exploration, 10 min recommendations
- **Outcome**: Clear action plan for follow-up or one-time recommendations

#### 2. Code Review Session
- **Goal**: Systematic review of existing code with actionable feedback
- **Time allocation**: 5 min overview, 30 min review, 10 min summary and next steps
- **Outcome**: Prioritized improvement list with examples

#### 3. Architecture Consultation
- **Goal**: Design or redesign software structure for scalability and maintainability
- **Time allocation**: 10 min requirements, 25 min design discussion, 10 min documentation
- **Outcome**: Architecture proposal with implementation guidance

#### 4. Training/Workshop Session
- **Goal**: Teach specific tools, practices, or patterns
- **Time allocation**: 5 min setup, 30 min hands-on teaching, 10 min Q&A and practice
- **Outcome**: Working examples and practice exercises

#### 5. Follow-up Session
- **Goal**: Review progress, troubleshoot issues, and continue improvement
- **Time allocation**: 10 min progress review, 30 min focused work, 5 min next steps
- **Outcome**: Updated recommendations and continued momentum

### Time Management (45-minute sessions)

**Strict time boundaries:**
- Start on time, end on time
- Reserve last 5-10 minutes for wrap-up and next steps
- If running over, schedule follow-up rather than rushing

**Time allocation framework:**
- **5-10 min**: Context and goal setting
- **25-35 min**: Active consultation work
- **5-10 min**: Summary, action items, and scheduling

## Success Metrics

### Immediate (end of session)
- ✓ Client understands the recommendations
- ✓ Client has concrete next steps
- ✓ Client feels more confident about their code
- ✓ Session stayed within time limit

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
- ✓ Client implements at least one recommendation
- ✓ Client successfully uses a new tool or practice
- ✓ Code quality improves measurably

### Long-term (ongoing)
- ✓ Client independently applies learned practices to new code
- ✓ Client seeks consultation earlier in development cycle
- ✓ Client recommends services to peers

## Communication Principles

### During Consultation
- **Ask open questions**: "Walk me through your thought process here"
- **Validate understanding**: "Let me confirm what I'm hearing..."
- **Explain the 'why'**: Don't just say what to change, explain why it matters
- **Use analogies**: Bridge to concepts from their research domain
- **Share screen/code**: Visual demonstrations are powerful
- **Check in frequently**: "Does this make sense?" "Any questions so far?"

### Written Communication
- **Clear and concise**: Researchers are busy; respect their time
- **Structured format**: Use headers, bullets, and numbering
- **Code examples**: Show, don't just tell
- **Resource links**: Point to documentation and tutorials
- **Action-oriented**: Focus on what they can do next

## Common Client Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "My code works but is slow"
**Approach:**
1. Profile the code to identify bottlenecks
2. Explain algorithmic complexity where relevant
3. Show vectorization/optimization techniques
4. Discuss when optimization is worth the effort

### Scenario 2: "I need to share my code with my advisor/lab"
**Approach:**
1. Review code organization and documentation
2. Set up version control if not already done
3. Add README with setup instructions
4. Ensure dependencies are documented
5. Discuss code commenting standards

### Scenario 3: "My code broke and I can't figure out why"
**Approach:**
1. Teach systematic debugging (print statements, debugger, logging)
2. Review error messages together
3. Identify root cause
4. Suggest preventive measures (testing, assertions)

### Scenario 4: "I'm starting a new project"
**Approach:**
1. Discuss project scope and requirements
2. Recommend appropriate structure and tools
3. Set up template/skeleton together if time permits
4. Establish development workflow from the start

### Scenario 5: "My code is unmaintainable/confusing"
**Approach:**
1. Identify refactoring opportunities
2. Demonstrate modular design principles
3. Show incremental refactoring approach
4. Prioritize high-impact, low-effort improvements

## Best Practices for Consultants

### Before Each Session
- ✓ Review intake form and any code shared in advance
- ✓ Test their code locally if possible
- ✓ Prepare relevant examples or templates
- ✓ Set up screenshare and recording (with permission)
- ✓ Have reference materials ready

### During Each Session
- ✓ Take notes on key points and action items
- ✓ Save any code examples you write
- ✓ Track time remaining
- ✓ Confirm understanding frequently
- ✓ Be encouraging and positive

### After Each Session
- ✓ Send summary within 24 hours
- ✓ Include all code examples and resources discussed
- ✓ Provide clear next steps
- ✓ Schedule follow-up if needed
- ✓ Document session for your records

## Boundaries and Scope

### In Scope
- Reviewing and advising on code structure and quality
- Teaching software engineering concepts and tools
- Providing examples and templates
- Recommending resources for further learning
- Debugging strategies and systematic troubleshooting

### Out of Scope (redirect appropriately)
- Writing entire projects from scratch (suggest pairing/teaching instead)
- Domain-specific algorithm development (collaborate with domain experts)
- Long-term maintenance commitments (establish sustainable practices instead)
- Emergency same-day requests (set expectations about availability)
- Statistical or scientific methods (refer to appropriate experts)

## Continuous Improvement

### After Each Session, Reflect On:
- What worked well?
- What could be improved?
- Did we stay on time?
- Did the client seem satisfied?
- What patterns am I seeing across clients?

### Monthly Review:
